###Instructions###

preface: the Makefile has most of the repeatable functions within the repository.  Most of the instructions are calls to the makefile, but you can always inspect the Makefile for sequential shell commands.  Also - as of this writing, the ENS client is not complete - there are stubs in the unit tests.

The unit tests assume a recently built, running docker image as generated by the instructions below.

This repo is unique in that this service (in the traditional network arch version) relies on python 3, [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), and [grpc](http://www.grpc.io/).  If you've got any trouble setting those up, either use the docker image, inspect the _Dockerfile_, or refer to the links to the protocol buffers and grpc project pages.

How to build the docker image:

    make build

How to run the docker image with the flags that expose the port the unittests are looking for:

How to run the unit tests:

    make test
